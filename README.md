# pseu-pseu-pseudo

## Give us your pseudocode!
For this problem set, your task is to write out the pseudocode for the experiment you'll be implementing for assignment #1. Think about the logic of your experiment, if/how you want to counterbalance, the sequence of a trial, what measures you want to collect, and so on. Then, using pseudocode that makes sense to you, write it out in some sort of structured format (e.g., detailed paragraphs, bulleted sequence of operations, indented code-like commands). Just make sure it is both human readable and detailed. If you don't know all the details of your experiment, that is fine. Make something up that's sensible, but the closer you are to the experiment you will implement, the more helpful this assignment will be later on!

## Deliverables
Your submission should be 1 text file with:
1. A brief paragraph describing of your experiment
2. Pseudocode detailing the hierarchy of your experiment
